# Final project for the course "Data Structures and Programming"

As part of the final project for the course "Data Structures and Programming", we developed a packet routing simulator that emulates data transmission through a linear network of routers. The system handled events such as router failures, resets, latency periods, and message reordering. The simulation was programmed in Python following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, and included features such as message encapsulation, event logging in CSV files, generation of per-router text files with received messages, and performance reporting through bar charts. The project focused on class design, data encapsulation, modularity, and efficient use of data structures.
